# FAIRmat Digital Flyer
Welcome to the FAIRmat Digital Flyer repository!  
This lightweight, responsive website replaces traditional printed flyers with a dynamic, mobile-friendly experience — accessible via QR code on business cards or other merchandize formats.

## 💡 Motivation

Printed materials like brochures or flyers are static, environmentally costly, and often outdated shortly after they're produced.

The **FAIRmat Digital Flyer** serves as:

- 🌱 A **sustainable alternative** to printed materials
- 📱 A **mobile-first experience** accessible instantly via QR code
- 🔗 A **central gateway** to FAIRmat, NOMAD, and related training resources
- 🔄 A **maintainable and version-controlled platform** using GitHub Pages


It reflects our commitment to **FAIR data**, **open science**, and **digital-first outreach**.
